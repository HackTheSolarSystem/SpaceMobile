# SpaceMobile

We build an AR game for kids to simulate the speed and distance of the Solar System using their phones in a classroom setting.
Every kid will need a device and will get assigned randomly a celestial body. If you are the sun, you stay where you are and other teammmates will get directions on how far they should move away from you and what speed to go around you. 

The team with the fastest time to assemble is the winner of this game. 

We have built this app using React Native and React Native AR.
